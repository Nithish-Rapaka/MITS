                **MITS (Modern Innovative Technical Students), organized by the Department of Information Technology in 2024, is a premier platform celebrating student innovation, creativity, and technical excellence. This vibrant event showcases a wide range of projects that reflect the latest industry trends, including artificial intelligence, autonomous drones, and advanced web development—skills that are highly demanded in today’s technology-driven world. Among the standout innovations is T.A.R.A. (Trained Algorithm for Responsive Actions), a humanoid robot developed by second-year B.Tech students, which combines AI, robotics, and interactive design to perform tasks such as guiding and assisting at events. Beyond T.A.R.A., MITS features numerous projects that demonstrate practical applications of cutting-edge technologies, empowering students to solve real-world problems with creativity and skill. The event also fosters learning through workshops, guest lectures, and collaborative sessions, providing participants with hands-on experience and industry insights.

                The success of MITS is guided by a dedicated leadership team including Sumayya Usmani, the first president, whose visionary leadership laid the foundation for this innovative platform; Gayathri, the Vice President, who ensures seamless coordination and execution of events; and Nithish, the Financial Officer, responsible for managing resources efficiently to support diverse initiatives. Together, they nurture an environment where young technologists develop the expertise and confidence needed to excel in the rapidly evolving digital landscape, making MITS a beacon of innovation, leadership, and excellence.**
